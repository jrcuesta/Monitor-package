# Monitor-package
Package to check the performance of quantitative models
The idea of the package is to compare the reference values to the predicted values and see if the performance is fine compared to the errors obtained during the calibration process (cross validation error for example).
Several plots and statistics are obtained, and also warning for adjustments if necessary.
